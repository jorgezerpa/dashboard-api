## How to run project Locally?

1. Clone this repository 
```
https://github.com/jorgezerpa/dashboard-api.git
```

1. Install all dependencies **(preferibly use clean install)**
```
npm ci 
```

1. create a __.env__ file on the root folder and set the needed variables. (You will find enviroment variables information on the **.env.example** file).

1. This project is a fullStack app. Since that, you need to download the API to be able to run things locally. You can found it [here](https://github.com/jorgezerpa/dashboard-ecommerce).

1. Once you have the API installed and running,  you can start the project with the command:
```
npm run dev
```

1. THAT'S ALL! here you can see the [documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17956788/2s8Z6x3DhN) of the core API.

### Happy coding my friend :)
